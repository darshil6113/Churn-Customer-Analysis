# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis

A complete end-to-end **Customer Churn Analysis** project using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for data analysis & machine learning and **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and business insights.

This project focuses on understanding why customers leave, identifying key churn drivers, and helping businesses take data-driven actions to improve customer retention.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the most critical metrics for subscription-based and service-driven businesses. This project analyzes customer behavior, identifies churn patterns, and builds predictive insights to reduce churn.

The project includes:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering & preprocessing
* Churn prediction modeling
* Business insights & recommendations
* Interactive Power BI dashboard

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level information such as:

* Demographics (age, gender, tenure)
* Service usage
* Subscription details
* Payment & billing information
* Churn status (Yes / No)

**Target Variable:** `Churn`

---

## 🧪 Jupyter Notebook Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook covers:

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Missing value handling
* Data distribution analysis
* Churn vs non-churn comparisons
* Correlation analysis

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

* Encoding categorical variables
* Feature scaling
* Train-test split

### 3️⃣ Machine Learning Models

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Model performance comparison

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-score
* Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

* Overall churn rate
* Churn by demographics
* Churn by service type
* Revenue impact analysis
* Customer segmentation insights

🎯 **Goal:** Enable stakeholders to quickly identify churn drivers and take action.

---

## 🚀 Key Insights

* Customers with shorter tenure have higher churn probability
* Month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn
* Certain services and payment methods are strong churn indicators
* Retention strategies should focus on high-risk customer segments

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Power BI**
* **Machine Learning**
